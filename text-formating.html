        The
    <p> tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. Its primary purpose is to structure and format text content
        on a web page, allowing developers to separate blocks of text for better readability and organization. When the
        browser renders HTML containing
    <p> tags, it typically adds space before and after the paragraph, visually indicating the beginning and end of each
        paragraph. Additionally, the
    <p> tag can be styled using CSS to adjust aspects such as font size, color, alignment, and spacing, further
        enhancing the presentation of text content on a webpage.
